Destiny JSON Server
-----

Destiny JSON Server is meant to be a lightweight system for json output only. It also allows for tracking of JSON Calls and complete control the command structure.

Destiny is only meant to be a interaction engine. Meaning, it provides all the appropriate APIs for you as the developer.

Features
------
- Simple JSON generation
- Admin interface
- Aggressive Caching available.
- Simple Page Handling

Usage
------
Each url action is mapped to a class, where the output from the class is then the returned json.

Admin Interface
------
Destiny includes an admin interface located at <root_url>/admin

Simple Page Handling
------
Destiny JSON includes the Destiny_Index object that can load in a simple page. This is useful if you want Destiny to also handle a javascript/html page along with the same JSON content.

API/Developer Information
------
All non-Destiny Code is required to be placed in the 'application/', where each subfolder/subfile is the actual class that is called. As long as the called object extends/is an instance of one of the following, Destiny_Db_MySQL, Destiny_Db_SQLite, Destiny_Db_Internal, then you can run the object.

Notes
-------
The JSON Server is only meant for quick real-time communication. There is an included index class that is essentially the way to get a simple PHP file for static HTML/Javascript. It allows that output to the web browsers.
