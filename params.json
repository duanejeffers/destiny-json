It also allows for tracking of JSON Calls and complete control of the command structure.\r\n\r\nDestiny is only meant to be a interaction engine. Meaning, it provides all the appropriate APIs for you as the developer.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Simple JSON generation\r\n* Aggressive Caching available.\r\n* Simple Page Handling\r\n\r\n## Simple Page Handling\r\nDestiny JSON includes the Destiny_Index object that can load in a simple page. This is useful if you want Destiny to also handle a javascript/html page along with the same JSON content.\r\n\r\n## API/Developer Information\r\nAll non-Destiny Code is required to be placed in the 'application/', where each subfolder/subfile is the actual class that is called. As long as the called object extends/is an instance of one of the following, Destiny_Db_MySQL, Destiny_Db_SQLite, Destiny_Db_Internal, then you can run the object.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThe JSON Server is only meant for quick real-time communication. There is an included index class that is essentially the way to get a simple PHP file for static HTML/Javascript. It allows that output to the web browsers.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Duane Jeffers <destiny-json@duanejeffers.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
